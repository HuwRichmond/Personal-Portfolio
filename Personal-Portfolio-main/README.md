# Personal-Portfolio
Personal portfolio created as part of UADEL coding boot camp

stage 1 of the personal portfolio was created to include the following components:

- a webpage that showcases my work. Future deployed applications will be linked to the portfolio.
Placeholder link was created using the application from week 1 of the coding bootcamp

- a webpage that includes a recent photo and/or avatar.
headshot was taken and is displayed on the page. 100px X 100px placeholder image is used to represent space for an avatar.

- links that scroll to relevant sections.
there is a navbar at the top of the page. URL links are included for github and linkedin and the page navigates to the contact me and portfolio sections of the page using the anchor function.

- a page that responds to resizing of the screen
page adapts to a layout better suited to viewing on smartphones when page is viewed on small screen, nav bar stacks on tap and sidebar moves to the bottom rather than the side.

page deployed via github on the 20/06/2022.
